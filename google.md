# Parent Inc

Alphabet Inc. is the parent company that owns several subsidiaries or divisions. As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, Alphabet had more than 200 subsidiaries. Some of the well-known subsidiaries of Alphabet include Google LLC, YouTube LLC, Waymo LLC, and Verily Life Sciences LLC. However, the exact number of subsidiaries under Alphabet Inc. may have changed since my knowledge cutoff date.


# Amonut of employees

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Google LLC (a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.) had over 135,000 employees worldwide. However, it's important to note that this number may have changed since then as companies frequently hire and lay off employees, and also, Google is known for being selective in its hiring process, which can affect the total number of employees.

I do not have access to the specific number of employees of Google in the United States as of February 2023, but as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Google LLC had over 100,000 employees globally, with the majority of them being based in the United States. However, it's important to note that this number may have changed since then, and it's also possible that not all of Google's US-based employees work for Google US Inc., as there are many subsidiaries and divisions within the broader Google organization.
